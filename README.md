# What is the Data Structure  

 Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages.There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge of data structures.

# What is the Data Type  

 A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support various types of data, including integer, real, character or string, and boolean.

# How Data Structure varies from Data Type  

| Data Type | Data Structure |
|-----------|----------------|
|The data type is the form of a variable to which a value can be assigned. It defines that the particular variable will assign the values of the given data type only.| Data structure is a collection of different kinds of data. That entire data can be represented using an object and can be used throughout the program. |
|It can hold value but not data. Therefore, it is dataless.|It can hold multiple types of data within a single object. |
|The implementation of a data type is known as abstract implementation.|Data structure implementation is known as concrete implementation |
|There is no time complexity in the case of data types.|In data structure objects, time complexity plays an important role. |
|In the case of data types, the value of data is not stored because it only represents the type of data that can be stored.|While in the case of data structures, the data and its value acquire the space in the computerâ€™s main memory. Also, a data structure can hold different kinds and types of data within one single object. |
|Data type examples are int, float, double, etc.|Data structure examples are stack, queue, tree, etc.|
