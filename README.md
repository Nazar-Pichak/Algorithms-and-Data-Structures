# What is the Data Structure

>Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages.There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge of data structures.# What is the Data Type   A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support various types of data, including integer, real, character or string, and boolean.

## How Data Structure varies from Data Type

| Data Type | Data Structure |
|-----------|----------------|
|The data type is the form of a variable to which a value can be assigned. It defines that the particular variable will assign the values of the given data type only.| Data structure is a collection of different kinds of data. That entire data can be represented using an object and can be used throughout the program. |
|It can hold value but not data. Therefore, it is dataless.|It can hold multiple types of data within a single object. |
|The implementation of a data type is known as abstract implementation.|Data structure implementation is known as concrete implementation |
|There is no time complexity in the case of data types.|In data structure objects, time complexity plays an important role. |
|In the case of data types, the value of data is not stored because it only represents the type of data that can be stored.|While in the case of data structures, the data and its value acquire the space in the computer’s main memory. Also, a data structure can hold different kinds and types of data within one single object. |
|Data type examples are int, float, double, etc.|Data structure examples are stack, queue, tree, etc.|


## Classification of Data Structure

## Linear data structure

> Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next  adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.
> Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc. and they divided into two parts as well.

- Static data structure 

> Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.
> An example of this data structure is an array.

- Dynamic data structure

> In the dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.

## Non-linear data structure

>Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
>Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.

> The word Algorithm means “A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations” Or “A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations “.
> Therefore Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.
> Algorithms can be simple and complex depending on what you want to achieve.

## Classification of algorithms

- Brute Force Algorithm

>It is the simplest approach for a problem.
> A brute force algorithm is the first approach that comes to finding when we see a problem.

- Recursive Algorithm

>A recursive algorithm is based on recursion.
>In this case, a problem is broken into several sub-parts and called the same function again and again.

- Backtracking Algorithm

>The backtracking algorithm basically builds the solution by searching among all possible solutions. Using this algorithm, we keep on building the solution following criteria. Whenever a solution fails we trace back to the failure point and build on the next solution and continue this process till we find the solution or all possible solutions are looked after.
>

- Searching Algorithm

>Searching algorithms are the ones that are used for searching elements or groups of elements from a particular data structure.
>They can be of different types based on their approach or the data structure in which the element should be found.

- Sorting Algorithm

> Sorting is arranging a group of data in a particular manner according to the requirement.
> The algorithms which help in performing this function are called sorting algorithms.
> Generally sorting algorithms are used to sort groups of data in an increasing or decreasing manner.

- Hashing Algorithm

>Hashing algorithms work similarly to the searching algorithm.
>But they contain an index with a key ID. In hashing, a key is assigned to specific data.

-  Divide and Conquer Algorithm

>This algorithm breaks a problem into sub-problems, solves a single sub-problem and merges the solutions together to get the final solution. It consists of the following three steps: ```👉 Divide  👉 Solve  👉 Combine``` 

- Greedy Algorithm 

> In this type of algorithm the solution is built part by part.
> The solution of the next part is built based on the immediate benefit of the next part.
> The one solution giving the most benefit will be chosen as the solution for the next part.

- Dynamic Programming Algorithm 

>This algorithm uses the concept of using the already found solution to avoid repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem.
>It divides the problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and solves them.

- Randomized Algorithm 

>In the randomized algorithm we use a random number so it gives immediate benefit.
>The random number helps in deciding the expected outcome.

- Pattern Searching

>The Pattern Searching algorithms are sometimes also referred to as String Searching Algorithms and are considered as a part of the String algorithms.
>These algorithms are useful in the case of searching a string within another string.

- Mathematical Algorithms

>These algorithms are designed to solve Mathematical and Number Theory problems.
>They requires in-depth knowledge of different mathematical concepts like 
> → GCD and LCM 
> → Prime Factorization and Divisors 
> → Fibonacci Numbers 
> → Catalan Numbers 
> → Modular Arithmetic 
> → Euler Totient Function 
> → nCr Computations 
> → Set Theory 
> → Factorial 
> → Prime numbers and Primality Tests 
> → Sieve Algorithms, etc.
