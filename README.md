# Practicing on Algorithms and Data Structures

Data structures are an integral part of computers used for the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their own characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages.There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge of data structures. 
# How Data Structure varies from Data Type

|                   Data Type                     |                       Data Structure                             |

|The data type is the form of a variable to which |Data structure is a collection of different kinds of data.        |
|a value can be assigned. It defines that the     |That entire data can be represented using an object and can be    |
|particular variable will assign the values of the|used throughout the program.                                      |
|given data type only.                            |                                                                  |

|It can hold value but not data.                  |It can hold multiple types of data within a single object.        |
|Therefore, it is dataless.                       |                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|The implementation of a data type is known as    |Data structure implementation is known as concrete implementation.|
|abstract implementation.                         |                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|There is no time complexity in the case          |In data structure objects, time complexity                        | 
|of data types.                                   |plays an important role.                                          |

|In the case of data type is not stored, because  |While in the case of data structures, the data and its value      |
|it only represents the type of data that that    |acquire the space in the computerâ€™s main memory. Also, a data     |
|can be stores.                                   |structure can hold different kinds and types of data within one   |
|                                                 |single object.                                                    |


  

Data type examples are int, float, double, etc.

Data structure examples are stack, queue, tree, etc.
